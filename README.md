##Random walk Metropolis

In this part, you are asked to work with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, in
particular the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The aim is to simulate random numbers
for the distribution with probability density function given below
f (x) = 1
2 exp (−|x|),
where x takes values in the real line and |x|denotes the absolute value of x. More
specifically, you are asked to generate x0, x1, . . . , xN values and store them using the
following version of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.

Apply the random walk Metropolis algorithm using N = 10000 and s = 1. Use the
generated samples (x1, . . . xN ) to construct a histogram and a kernel density plot in
the same figure. Note that these provide estimates of f (x).Overlay a graph of f (x) on
this figure to visualise the quality of these estimates. Also, report the sample mean
and standard deviation of the generated samples (Note: these are also known as the
Monte Carlo estimates of the mean and standard deviation respectively).
